# Task Cache: Wednesday, May 21st, 2025

## What I Did
- Refactored authentication middleware to handle rate limiting
- Fixed bug #231 with session expiration (was a cookie timing issue)
- Started investigating memory leak in analytics module
- PR review for team member's frontend components
- Updated API documentation for the new user endpoints

## What's Next
- Write unit tests for the new rate limiter
- Complete memory leak investigation (focus on third-party SDK)
- Start implementing the new notification system
- Prepare for tomorrow's API design review meeting
- Follow up with product team about mobile app requirements

## What Broke or Got Weird
- Memory leak appears to be coming from the third-party analytics SDK
- AWS Lambda logs are delayed by ~5 minutes today
- Intermittent 401 errors from auth service during peak load
- Database query for user profiles suddenly running 2x slower
- Build pipeline failed twice due to timeout issues

## Notes
- Productivity today: 4/5
- Need to follow up with DevOps about AWS CloudWatch alerts
- Good conversation with product team about notification priority levels
- Found a useful Stack Overflow solution for the session bug
- Team lunch discussion about adopting TypeScript was productive
